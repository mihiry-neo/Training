# Python's `datetime` Module

This project demonstrates how to use Python's `datetime` module to work with dates, times, and timedeltas.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Datetime Class**: Combines both date and time.
- **Date Class**: Handles date operations (year, month, day).
- **Time Class**: Handles time operations (hour, minute, second).
- **Timedelta Class**: Represents the difference between two `datetime` or `date` objects.
- **Timezone Class**: Manages time zone information for `datetime` or `time` objects.

## Key Operations

- Calculated minimum and maximum values for `datetime` and `date`.
- Created and manipulated `datetime`, `date`, and `time` objects.
- Used `timedelta` to calculate time differences.
- Worked with time zones using the `timezone` class.
- Formatted and parsed `datetime` objects.

This script provides an overview of how to use the `datetime` module for handling date and time operations in Python.

# SQL `Joins` with Python and MySQL

This project demonstrates various SQL joins using a Python script to create tables and execute queries.

## Tables Used

- **`Students`**
- **`Courses`**
- **`Enrollments`**

These tables are used to demonstrate different types of SQL joins.

## Joins Covered

- **`Inner Join`**
- **`Left Join`**
- **`Right Join`**
- **`Cross Join`**
- **`Full Outer Join`**
- **`Left Anti Join`**
- **`Right Anti Join`**

Each of the above joins is explained and demonstrated with sample SQL queries executed using Python and MySQL.
