# Python Web Frameworks â€“ Day05 - 11/6/25

---

## Flask
- Learned how to set up and run a basic `Flask` app.
- Explored routing using `@app.route`, returning both `HTML` and `JSON` responses.
- Handled query parameters and form data.
- Organized the app using `templates/` and `static/` folders.
- Used debug mode for development and styling with CSS.

**Mini-Project**: Created a user lookup API that returns user info via both URL path and form input, with proper error handling and styled HTML templates.

---

## FastAPI
- Set up a `FastAPI` app with `Uvicorn` server.
- Used `@app.get`, `@app.post`, and path/query parameters for routing.
- Implemented `Pydantic` models for request validation.
- Worked with `JSON` requests/responses and explored auto-generated docs at `/docs` and `/redoc`.

**Mini-Project**: Built an API that accepts user data via `POST` request and returns a structured summary using Pydantic validation.

---

## Django
- Installed and initialized a `Django` project and app.
- Understood the `MTV` (Model-Template-View) architecture.
- Created models, applied migrations, and used the Django Admin for CRUD.
- Defined basic views and routes to serve both `HTML` and `JSON` responses.

**Mini-Project**: Developed a book management system with CRUD operations via the Django Admin panel and simple user-facing views.

---

## Skills Practiced
- API design with `Flask`, `FastAPI`, and `Django`
- Routing, form handling, and response formatting
- Model definition, validation, and admin-based data management
- Use of templates, static files, and debug tools
- Building complete mini-projects to reinforce backend development concepts
